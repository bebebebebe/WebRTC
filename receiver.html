    <h3>WebRTC Demo: Receiver</h3>
    <p>This is a WebRTC demo, to be used on Chrome. To use it, open Chrome's JavaScript console (from the menu, View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console), and follow the instructions in the console.</p>

    <p>This should work if you open this file in your browser locally (eg after cloning the repo), or if you use the hosted demo page.</p>

    <p>You're playing the role of the "receiver", and someone else in your wifi network (or you in a different tab) should play the role of "sender."</p>

    <p>Once connected, you'll be able to chat back and forth: that means two browsers are sending each other messages directly, without a server!</p>
